<h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Abas"
title="Abas">Abas</a></h2> (A´bas), a son of Meganira, was turned into a newt,
or water-lizard, for deriding the ceremonies
of the Sacrifice.</p>

<p><a id="Absyrtus"></a><h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Absyrtus" title="Absyrtus">Absyrtus</a></h2> (Absy´rtus). After Jason had slain the dragon
which guarded the golden fleece, he fled with
Medea, the beautiful young sorceress, and
daughter of Aeetes, who pursued with great
energy, for Medea had taken with her the
most precious treasure of the king, his only
son and heir, Absyrtus. To delay the pursuit,
Medea slew her little brother, cut the
body in pieces, and dropped them over the
side of the vessel. Thus the cruel daughter
effected her escape.</p>

<p><a id="Achelous"></a><h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Achelous" title="Achelous">Achelous</a></h2> (Achelo´us) was a river god, and the rival of Hercules
in his love for Deianira. To decide
who should have the bride, Hercules and
Achelous had recourse to a wrestling bout, the
fame of which extends through all the intervening
centuries. In this fierce struggle,
Achelous changed himself into the form of a
bull and rushed upon his antagonist with
lowered horns, intending to hurl him aside.
Hercules eluded the onset, and seizing one of
the huge horns, held it so firmly that it was
broken off by the furious efforts of Achelous
to free himself. He was defeated, and finally
turned himself into a river, which has since
been known by his name.</p>

<p><a id="Acheron"></a><h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Acheron" title="Acheron">Acheron</a></h2> (Ach´eron).
The current of the river Acheron,
across which all souls had to pass to hear their
decree from Pluto, was so swift that the boldest
swimmer dare not attempt to breast it;
and, since there was no bridge, the spirits
were obliged to rely upon the aid of Charon,
an aged boatman, who plied the only boat
that was available. He would allow no soul
to enter this leaky craft until he had received
the obolus, or fare, which the ancients carefully
placed under the tongue of the dead,
that they might not be delayed in their passage
to Pluto. Those who had not their fare
were forced to wait one hundred years, when
Charon reluctantly ferried them over without
charge.</p>



<p><a id="Achilles"></a><h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Achilles" title="Achilles">Achilles</a></h2> (Achil´les) was the most valiant of the Greek heroes
in the Trojan War. He was the son of Peleus,
King of Thessaly. His mother, Thetis,

plunged him, when an infant, into the Stygian
pool, which made him invulnerable wherever
the waters had washed him; but the heel by
which he was held was not wetted, and that
part remained vulnerable. He was shot with
an arrow in the heel by Paris, at the siege of
Troy, and died of his wound.</p>

was one of the few great captains who escaped
the destruction of Troy. He behaved with
great valor during the siege, encountering
Diomed, and even Achilles himself. When
the Grecians had set the city on fire Aeneas

took his aged father, Anchises, on his shoulders,
while his son, Ascanius, and his wife
Creusa, clung to his garments. He saved
them all from the flames. After wandering
about during several years, encountering
numerous difficulties, he at length arrived in
Italy, where he was hospitably received by
Latinus, king of the Latins. After the death
of Latinus Aeneas became king.</p>



<p><a id="Aeolus"></a><h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Aeolus" title="Aeolus">Aeolus</a></h2> (Aeo´lus) was the god of the winds. Jupiter was
his reputed father, and his mother is said to
have been a daughter of Hippotus. Aeolus is
represented as having the power of holding
the winds confined in a cavern, and occasionally
giving them liberty to blow over the
world. So much command was he supposed
to have over them that when Ulysses visited
him on his return from Troy he gave him,
tied up in a bag, all the winds that could prevent
his voyage from being prosperous. The
companions of Ulysses, fancying that the bag
contained treasure, cut it open just as they
came in sight of Ithaca, the port they were
making for, and the contrary winds rushing
out drove back the ship many leagues. The

residence of Aeolus was at Strongyle, now
called Strombolo.</p>



<p><a id="Aesculapius"></a><h2><a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/Books/Mythological-Characters/Mythological-Characters.html#Aesculapius" title="Aesculapius">Aesculapius</a></h2> (Aescula´pius), the god of physic, was a son of
Apollo. He was physician to the Argonauts
in their famous expedition to Colchis. He
became so noted for his cures that Pluto became
jealous of him, and he requested Jupiter
to kill him with a thunderbolt. To revenge
his son's death Apollo slew the Cyclops who
had forged the thunderbolt. By his marriage
with Epione he had two sons, Machaon and
Podalirius, both famous physicians, and four
daughters, of whom Hygeia, the goddess of
health, is the most renowned. Many temples
were erected in honor of Aesculapius, and
votive tablets were hung therein by people
who had been healed by him; but his most
famous shrine was at Epidaurus, where,
every five years, games were held in his
honor. This god is variously represented,
but the most famous statue shows him seated
on a throne of gold and ivory. His head is
crowned with rays, and he wears a long
beard. A knotty stick is in one hand, and a
staff entwined with a serpent is in the other,
while a dog lies at his feet.</p>

heaps of earth or turf or rough unhewn stone;
but as the mode of sacrificing became more
ceremonious grander altars were built. Some
were of marble and brass, ornamented with
carvings and bas-reliefs, and the corners with
models of the heads of animals. They varied
in height from two feet to twenty, and some
were built solid; others were made hollow to
retain the blood of the victims. Some were
provided with a kind of dish, into which
frankincense was thrown to overpower the

the Isle of Delos, and this same island being
his native place obtained for him the name of
Delius; Delphinius, from his occasionally assuming

killed the serpent Python. Apollo is usually

beard, crowned with laurel, and having in
one hand a bow, and in the other a lyre. The

The goddess Juno hated him from his birth,
and sent two serpents to kill him, but though
only eight months old he strangled them.
As he got older he was set by his master
Eurystheus what were thought to be twelve
impossible tasks which have long been known
as the "Twelve Labors of Hercules." They
were:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, To slay the Nemean Lion.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, To destroy the Hydra which infested
the marshes of Lerna.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, To bring to Eurystheus the Arcadian
Stag with the golden horns and brazen
hoofs.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, To bring to his master the Boar of
Erymanthus.</p>

<p>
<i>Fifth</i>, To cleanse the stable of King Augeas,
in which 3,000 oxen had been kept for thirty
years, but had never been cleaned out.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>, To destroy the Stymphalides, terrible
carnivorous birds.</p>

<p><i>Seventh</i>, To capture the Bull which was desolating
Crete.</p>

<p><i>Eighth</i>, To capture the mares of Diomedes,
which breathed fire from their nostrils, and
ate human flesh.</p>

<p><i>Ninth</i>, To procure the girdle of Hippolyte,
queen of the Amazons.</p>

<p><i>Tenth</i>, To bring to Eurystheus the flesh-eating
oxen of Geryon, the monster king of Gades.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh</i>, To bring away some of the golden
apples from the garden of the Hesperides.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth</i>, To bring up from Hades the three-headed
dog, Cerberus.</p>

<p>All these tasks he successfully accomplished,
and, besides, he assisted the gods in their
wars with the giants. Several other wonderful
feats are mentioned under other headings,
as Antaeus, Cacus, etc. His death was
brought about through his endeavors to preserve
Deianira from the attacks of Nessus,
the centaur, whom he killed. The centaur,
before he expired, gave his mystic tunic to
Deianira, who in turn gave it to Hercules, and
he put it on, but his doing so brought on an
illness of which he could not be cured. In a
fit of desperation he cast himself into a funeral
pile on Mount Oeta; but Jupiter had him
taken to heaven in a four-horse chariot, and
only the mortal part of Hercules was consumed.</p>

Aeeta sent him to fetch the Golden Fleece from
Colchis (see Argonauts). He went in the
ship Argo with forty-nine companions, the
flower of Greek youth. With the help of
Juno they got safe to Colchis, but the King
Aeetes promised to restore the Golden Fleece
only on condition that the Argonauts

performed certain services. Jason was to tame
the wild fiery bulls, and to make them plow
the field of Mars; to sow in the ground the
teeth of a serpent, from which would spring
armed men who would fight against him who
plowed the field of Mars; to kill the fiery
dragon which guarded the tree on which the
Golden Fleece was hung. The fate of Jason
and the rest of the Argonauts seemed certain;
but Medea, the king's daughter, fell in love
with Jason, and with the help of charms
which she gave him he overcame all the difficulties
which the king had put in his way.
He took away the Golden Fleece and Medea
also. The king sent his son Absyrtus to overtake
the fugitives, but Medea killed him, and
strewed his limbs in his father's path, so that
he might be delayed in collecting them, and
this enabled Jason and Medea to escape.
After a time Jason got tired of Medea, and
married Glauce, which cruelty Medea revenged
by killing her children before their
father's eyes. Jason was accidentally killed
by a beam of the ship Argo falling on him.</p>

generally seen playing a pipe made of reeds
of various lengths, which he invented himself,
and from which he could produce music
which charmed even the gods. These are
the Pan-pipes, or <i>Syrinx</i>. Pan's terrific appearance
once so frightened the Gauls when
they invaded Greece that they ran away

her by the Graces. She was taught singing
by Apollo, and Mercury taught her oratory.
Jupiter gave her a box, the famous "Pandora's
Box," which she was told to give to her
husband, Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus.
As soon as he opened it there issued from it
numberless diseases and evils which were
soon spread all over the world, and from that
moment they have afflicted the human race.

It is said that Hope alone remained in the
box. Pandora means "the all-gifted."</p>

temple of all the gods, built by Agrippa at

mother Hecuba. It had been predicted
that he would be the cause of the destruction
of Troy, and his father therefore ordered him
to be strangled as soon as he was born; but
the slave who had been entrusted with this
mission took the child to Mount Ida, and left
it there. Some shepherds, however, found
the infant and took care of him. He lived
among them till he had grown to man's

estate, and he then married Oenone, a nymph
of Ida. At the famous nuptial feast of Peleus
and Thetis, Discordia, who had not been invited,
attended secretly; and when all were
assembled, she threw among the goddesses
a golden apple, on which was inscribed "Let
the fairest take it." This occasioned a great
contention, for each thought herself the fairest.
Ultimately, the contestants were reduced
to three, Juno, Pallas (Minerva), and Venus;
but Jove himself could not make these three
agree, and it was decided that Paris should
be the umpire. He was sent for, and each of
the goddesses courted his favor by offering
all sorts of bribes. Juno offered him power,
Pallas wisdom, and Venus promised him the
most beautiful woman in the world. Paris
gave the golden apple to Venus. Soon after
this episode Priam owned Paris as his son,
and sent him to Greece to fetch Helen, who
was renowned as being the most beautiful
woman in the world. She was the wife of
Menelaus, king of Sparta; but during his absence
Paris carried Helen away to Troy, and
this gave rise to the celebrated war between
the Greeks and the Trojans, which ended in
the destruction of Troy. Paris was among
the 676,000 Trojans who fell during or after
the siege.</p>

the gods. To every deity a distinct victim
was allotted, and the greatest care was always
taken in the selection of them. Anything
in any way blemished was considered
as an insult to the god. At the time of the
sacrifice the people were called together by
heralds led by a procession of musicians.
The priest, clothed in white, was crowned
with a wreath made of the leaves of the tree
which was sacred to the particular god to
whom the sacrifice was offered. The victim
had its horns gilt, and was adorned with a
chaplet similar to that of the priest, and was
decorated with bright-colored ribbons. The

priest then said, "Who is here?" to which
the spectators replied, "Many good people."
"Begone all ye who are profane," said the
priest; and he then began a prayer addressed
to all the gods. The sacrifice was begun by
putting corn, frankincense, flour, salt, cakes,
and fruit on the head of the victim. This
was called the Immolation. The priest then
took a cup of wine, tasted it, and handed it
to the bystanders to taste also; some of it
was then poured between the horns of the
victim, and a few of the saturated hairs were
pulled off and put in the fire which was burning
on the altar. Then, turning to the east,
the priest drew with his knife a crooked line
along the back of the beast from the head to
the tail, and told the assistants to kill the
animal. This was done directly, and the entrails
of the victim taken out and carefully
examined by the Haruspices to find out what
was prognosticated. The carcase was then
divided, and the thighs, covered with fat,
were put in the fire, and the rest of the animal
was cut up, cooked, and eaten. This
feast was celebrated with dancing, music,
and hymns, in praise of the god in whose
honor the sacrifice was made. On great occasions
as many as a hundred bullocks were
offered at one time; and it is said that Pythagoras
made this offering when he found out
the demonstration of the forty-seventh proposition
of the book of Euclid.</p>

in connection with the Trojan war, and his
adventures on his return therefrom, are the
subject of Homer's Odyssey. His wife's
name was Penelope, and he was so much endeared
to her that he feigned madness to get
himself excused from going to the Trojan
war; but this artifice was discovered, and he

was compelled to go. He was of great help
to the Grecians, and forced Achilles from his
retreat, and obtained the charmed arrows of
Hercules from Philoctetes, and used them
against the Trojans. He enabled Paris to
shoot one of them at the heel of Achilles, and
so kill that charmed warrior. During his
wanderings on his homeward voyage he was
taken prisoner by the Cyclopes and escaped,
after blinding Polyphemus, their chief. At
Aeolia he obtained all the winds of heaven,
and put them in a bag; but his companions,
thinking that the bags contained treasure
which they could rob him of when they got to
Ithaca, cut the bags, and let out the winds,
and the ships were immediately blown back
to Aeolia. After Circe had turned his companions
into swine on an island where he and
they were shipwrecked, he compelled the goddess
to restore them to their human shape
again. As he passed the islands of the Sirens
he escaped their allurements by stopping the
ears of his companions with wax, and fastening
himself to the mast of his ship. His wife
Penelope was a pattern of constancy; for,
though Ulysses was reported to be dead, she
would not marry any one else, and had the
satisfaction of finding her husband return
after an absence of about twenty years. The
Greek name of Ulysses is Odysseus.</p>

nothing can be more appropriate than St.
Paul's address to the Athenians, as recorded
in the 17th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Ye</i> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are
too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your
devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, <small>TO THE
UNKNOWN GOD</small>. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
him declare I unto you. God that made the world and
all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and
earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither
is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything,
seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men for
to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
that they should seek the Lord, if haply they
might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far
from every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and
have our being; as certain also of your own poets have
said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as
we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that
the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man's device. And the times of this ignorance
God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere
to repent: because he hath appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world in righteousness by
<em>that</em> man whom he hath ordained; <em>whereof</em> he hath given
assurance unto all <em>men</em>, in that he hath raised him from
the dead."</p>
